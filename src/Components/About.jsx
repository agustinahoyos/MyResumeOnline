  <p> I am a 26 year old web developer from Argentina, commited to learn more about programming everyday. I enjoy solving problems, 
    and overcoming real challenges. In my opinion, a dynamic and ballanced teamwork is the most valuable tool to do so.
     My goal is to become an expert in the area, and be able to teach what I have learned.</p>
     <p>During my 7 years of experience in customer service, I have developed strong interpersonal relationships
       and very good communication skills. My soft skills are very useful when it comes to integrating people,
        and improving group performance.
